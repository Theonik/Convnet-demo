\chapter{Third-Party Code and Libraries}

For this dissertation I have used the following libraries as stated in the design documentation:

\section{Keras}
Neural network library allowing quick model prototyping.\cite{chollet2015keras} and simplifies some GPU operations which would otherwise have to be implemented.

\section{SciKit Learn}
Visualisation and statistical tools for machine learning. Can be found here \hyperref{http://scikit-learn.org/stable/}
