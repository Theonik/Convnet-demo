\end{center}

An investigation of the use of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for image classification using statistical means. This report aims to test the hypothesis that DCNNs are suitable to classify images in a product style environment.
This report will investigate a number of hyper parameters and their impact in performance, practicality, and training in an attempt to produce a successful classifier that can be reproduced by third party sources.
Wherever possible our aim is full disclosure of any assumptions and any compromises that have been made to enhance the reproducibility of our results.
