These were done before the experimental infastructure was complete so we don't have complete figures recorded for them. These accounts are based on logs and diary entries taken at the time. Rapid prototyping was taking place at the time so results might not be consistent. As a result this section is included in a pure discussion format and is aimed to offer some insight to early decisions taken in this project.\subsubsection{Early Experiments}
