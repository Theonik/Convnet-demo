Background and Objectives
-Introduction
 #Summary of premise for the rest of document, what is the purpose, why are we doing this
 
--Background Motivation
  #Data-mining and searching through poorly organised images
 
--Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition
  #Briefly talk about the motivations and methods of machine learning and Pattern Recognition.

-Background
  
--SVMs and the 'Old Guard'
  #Talk about SVMs and alternative ML methods
  
--Artificial Neural Networks
  #Introduce Neural Networks and talk about how they differ from SVMs talk about feature extraction
  
--Image Classification and CIFAR-10
  #Introduce the problem of image classification and the CIFAR-10 Dataset
  
--Types of architectures and past successful models
  #Present some background research into different kinds of model
  
---SVM, MLP, CNN

--Variables and Training

---Parameters to tweak
  #Present the main parameters that are usually modified to create models for a task
  
---Training Strategy

---Evaluation Strategies

-Analysis
--How do ANNs compare with what used to be state of the art
--What type of ANN is best suited to the task
--What structure of ANN is best suited to the task
--What parameters are best suited to the task
--Can this be applied to a product

-Research Method
--Benchmarking
--Variables to test
--Correlating past research
